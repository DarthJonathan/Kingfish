# Kingfish

*We will (at least we expect to) be graduating on 2018.
From then on we won't be maintaining Portal anymore since we will no longer be studying on Binus.
Let us know If you're interested in keeping Portal alive, well after 2018.*

Portal gives you instant and easy access to your schedules and other
university-related data that are available on Binusmaya, online or offline.

This code currently uses the libraries and language listed below extensively.
Basic knowledge on the functionality and design of these libraries and
language will be required to understand this codebase.

#### [Kotlin (Programming language)](https://kotlinlang.org/)
A programming language developed by jetbrains, the team behind Intellij
and Android Studio. It reduces boilerplate significantly. To learn or try kotlin, you can use the the
[Kotlin Koans](http://try.kotlinlang.org/)

#### [Realm (Database)](https://realm.io/)
An object database built from the ground up for mobile application

#### Libraries
1. [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/), used to handle asynchronous task
2. [Anko](https://github.com/Kotlin/anko), a library to interact with layouts, based on kotlin
3. [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/), for handling network calls
4. [Joda-Time](http://www.joda.org/joda-time/) for handling date and time

#### Other DevTools
1. [Stetho](http://facebook.github.io/stetho/), basically a chrome devtool for android by facebook, insanely awesome and useful

*To build this project, Android Studio 2.3 or newer with the Kotlin plugin
installed will be required. This is sort of like an experimental project for us to try new technologies,
so we tend to go with experimental stuff here too (Eg. dependencies and tools that's still on beta or
alpha stage).*

### Contributing

This codebase is open, we would love if you would help to try to fix bugs
and defects that you find, or even implements new functionality (like attendance info for example).

In the end, we are here to learn and experiment to better work and collaborate
with multiple people and build better software. We would love if anyone
wanted to contribute to this project :).

#### How To

This is our first time dealing with open source contribution, but here are our suggestion on how to start contributing:

1. Create a new issue, telling us your suggestion or what you wanted to do so that we can have a discussion.
2. Fork the repository and create a new branch and push your changes into that branch
3. Create a pull request
4. We'll review the code changes and discuss any possible improvement together
5. When the code is ready we'll merge it.

We are still figuring out how to do this so this is just a suggestion from us.
